This is a simple and functional **Calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I created it as a frontend practice project to strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation and basic arithmetic logic in JavaScript.

## ✨ Features

- Supports basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear and delete functionality
- Keyboard support (if implemented)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop screens

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for creating the structure
- **CSS** – for styling the calculator layout
- **JavaScript** – for handling calculations and user interactions

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Handling user input via buttons and/or keyboard
- Writing clean and reusable JavaScript functions
- Managing edge cases (e.g., dividing by zero, decimal handling)
- DOM manipulation and event listeners

## 📌 Note

This calculator is a **beginner-level project** made to practice core JavaScript concepts and UI creation.
